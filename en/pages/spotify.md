# Spotify app, XCode

So, my case:
My mother is instructur for circle training and she wanted an app to Control the music volume up and down every time intervall.

## Old approach

I allready made an app for her several years ago. (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=erik.interva)
Though this has a couple of problems. First off, it sucks. Secondly, turning the volume of her phone (a new Samsung) up and down causes som wierd volume jumping. This is because of Samsung`s built inn ear protection. When the app turns the music too high, Samsung turns it back down again (Way low).

## New approach

Since Android is kinda buggy, I´ll jump into XCode and use Spotify´s iOS SDK directly. (I Could´ve used Xamarin, but something crashed... And since the app should be freakin simple, I`ll just do it..)
